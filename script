Once upon a time, Gru and his family of daughters and minions were very bored.
Then they decided to steal the moon when they saw it last night.

Gru started to make a plan to steal the moon. He was in his laboratory for three days straight.
He invented the shrink ray and a space ship that would take him to the moon.

There was one problem, Gru was broke! He went to the bank to get a high-interest loan, and
victor was there and heard about his plan.

Gru built his spaceship and went to the moon. He shruk it, but then Victor stole it from him.
Gru was very angry.

Victor was laughing then the moon grew back up. It went back to its original size and then
back to where it was. Gru decided to never go to space again.
